=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $fact = CPAN::Testers::Fact::InstalledModules->new({
    resource => 'cpan:///distfile/RJBS/CPAN-Metabase-Fact-0.001.tar.gz',
    content     => {
      prereqs => {
        'Test::More' => '0.80',
      },
      toolchain => {
        'CPAN' => '1.92', 
      },
    },
  });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Versions detected of modules installed on a system.  There are three valid
types: prereqs, toolchain, undeclared.  

Prereqs are the versions of modules listed in any of the prerequisite fields.  

Toolchain module versions are intended to reflect the state of the toolchain
used to test the distribution (e.g.  CPAN, Test::Harness, etc.).  

Undeclared module versions capture the version of modules that were detected
as being used by the distribution, but that were not listed explicitly as 
prerequisites.  This will often be core modules or submodules, but could 
include missing dependencies.

=head1 USAGE
